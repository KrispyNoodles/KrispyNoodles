## Hi there 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

I'm KrispyNoodles, a passionate developer and lifelong learner! Here's a little about me:

- 🔭 **My recent work is on**: Using Generative AI to turn wild ideas into reality.
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning**: Different Agent Architectures, Model Context Protocols (MCP), and Prompt Engineering.
- 💬 **Ask me about**: Data science, Large Language Models, Vibe Coding, or anything tech-related—I'm happy to help!
- 📫 **How to reach me**:  
  - Email: [joeylimjunfeng@gmail.com](mailto:joeylimjunfeng@gmail.com)  
  - LinkedIn: [linkedin.com/in/joeylimjf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joeylimjf/)
- ⚡ **Fun fact**: I thought that KrispyNoodles was a funny name since "Krispy" comes from the donut brand Krispy Kreme, and Crispy Noodles is an actual Hong Kong dish!
